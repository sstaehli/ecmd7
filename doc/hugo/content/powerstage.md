The design is dimensioned for high currents to continuously deliver up to 500W from 12V up to 60V. PWM frequencies are supported from 4 kHz up to 25kHz. 4 quadrant operation is possible with battery. There is no brake chopper.

- **Input Voltage**: 12V–48V (up to 60V abs max)
- **Output**: 35A RMS, 50A peak
- **60V/40A, low RDSOn MOSFETs** (N-channel, low R_DS(on))
- Mechanical reverse polarity protection
- Overvoltage protection

### Battery (J4) and Motor Phase Connections (U, V, W)

- A 12-48 Battery or 4-Qudrant Power Supply can be connected to the **XT60 connector J4** or the mounting holes **PGND** and **VMot**
- The Motor terminals can be connected to **M3 mounting holes U, V and W**
